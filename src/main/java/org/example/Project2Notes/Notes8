What is the final keyword,usage and purpose?
Final is a keyword  in java which  can be used with a class,
with a variable and with a method
When we use final keyword with an entity (class
or variable or method), it gets the meaning that
entity is complete and can not be modified
further.
final is a non access modifier
final entities are impossible to inherit or override.
The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...)
The uses of final keyword is to create constant variables, to prevent method overridign and to
prevent inheritance. The purpose of final keyword is immutability, adds a layer of security and for the
optimization of the entities.
