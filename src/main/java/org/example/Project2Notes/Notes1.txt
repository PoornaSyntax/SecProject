2. What is Constructor? Use of a Constructor in the class? The Difference between Constructor and a Method?
   Can we Overload a Constructor?

   Definition:

   Constructor in JAVA is used to create the "Instance" of the class. Constructor are almost similar to Methods, except
   for two things-
   it's name is the same as the "Class" name, and it has no "Return" type, even "Void".

   If there is no "Constructor" in the class, compiler automatically creates a default "Constructor".
   There are two types of Constructor:

   Non Argument Constructor
   Parameterized Constructor

   In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects.
   It is called when an object of a class is created, and it has the same name as the class itself.
   Constructors are used to set initial values for the object's attributes and perform any necessary setup tasks.


   The key differences between a constructor and a method are:

   Name:

   Constructor has the same name as the class.
   Method has its own distinct name.
   Return Type:

   Constructor has no return type, not even void.
   Method has a return type, which can be void or any other data type.
   Invocation:

   Constructor is "Implicitly"(Automatically) called when an object is created using the new keyword.
   Method is "Explicitly"(Manually) called using its name.
   Yes, you can overload a constructor.

   Constructor "Overloading" is the process of having multiple constructors in a class with different "Parameter-Lists".
   This allows you to create objects in different ways, providing flexibility to the users of your class.
