What is the constructor? Use of a constructor in the class? Difference
between constructor and a method? Can we overload a constructor?

Constructors are a special type of methods that is used to initialize objects. And they are
called when an object is created using the new key word.

Constructor have the same name as the class. Methods can have any valid name. Constructors do not have a return
type. Methods have a return type. Constructors are called to initailize an objects, methods are called to perform operations

We can overload a constructor, the process of having multiple constructors in a class with different
parameter list is constructor overloading.
