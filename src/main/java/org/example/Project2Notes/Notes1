1. What types of variables we have in Java. Define all of them and explain the
differences
There a re three types of variables.
1.Local varaiables
2.Instance variables
3.Instance a variables.

A local varaible is declared inside a method
A variable that is declared inside the class but outside the method. It is not declared as static.
A variable that is declared as static is static variable. It cannot be local.
Local variables will be destroyed once it exits the method , constructor or block.
Local voriables have the limited scope to the block where they are declared.  Instance variables
they are associated with specific instance of a class and parameters are local variables used to
pass values to methods or constructors. Static variables have a broader scope  which
can be shared among all instance of a class..
Local variables hava a narrow scope.

Final variables are whose value cannot be changed.
Variables passed to methods or constructors are parameter variables, they are limited to a method or a constructor.
The values are provided whenever the method or constructor are called.
Parameters are local variables used to pass values to methods or constructors.
