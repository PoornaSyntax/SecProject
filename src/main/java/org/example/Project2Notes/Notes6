6. What is Overriding? How can it be achieved? What can we override and
what we cannot?
It is a concept in oops that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method
that is already defined in its super class.
Whenever same method name is existing in both base class and derived class with same types of parameters
and same order and sequence of parameters is known as method Overriding.
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as
method overriding in java.
Note: Without Inheritance method overriding is not possible.

Main method cannot be overridden.
It can be achieved by having the same method signature name return type and parameters as the
method in its super class

We can override methods in subclass which have the same signature as the method in super class.
We cannot override the static methods and final methods. And also contructors cannot be overridden.
we can have the same access modifier or less restricted.
