What is Inheritance? Benefits? Types? Explain each type
Inheritance . Inheritance is one of the features of oops which allows a class to inherit
properties and behaviours from another class.
extends is the keyword used to inherit properties or methods of a class.
Benefits - reusability of code in subclass.
Benefits of inheritance is method overriding.
(Subclass can provide a specific implementaion for methods inherited from the superclass)
With inheritance we can achieve polymorphism.
Eliminates repetition of code

Single inheritance are when a subclass inherit from only one super class.
Multiple Inheritance-a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses(interfaces).The concept of multiple
inheritance is not supported by Java, but it can be supported with the concept of interface.

multi-level inheritance -A class is derived from another class and another class is derived from it
forming a chain.
Hybrid inheritance- A combination of two or more types of inheritance. That means it is a combination
of single, multiple and multilevel or hierarchical inheritance.
