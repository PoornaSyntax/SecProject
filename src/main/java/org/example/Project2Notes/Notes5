What is Overloading? How can it be achieved? What can we overload and
what we cannot?

The ability to define multiple functions or methods with the same name but with
a different parameters or arguments which allows to use the same  function or method name
for different operations based on the input argument is a method overloading
We can achieve method overloading by using the same method name but different parameter list.
To achieve method overloading the return type must be the same.
Overloaded methods give programmers the flexibility
to call a similar method for different types of data.

We can overload constructors and methods.  we cannot overload methods with same method signature.
same access modifier , same return type and same method name in the method signature should be there
with a different parameter list.
