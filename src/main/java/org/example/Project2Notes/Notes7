What is Polymorphism? Types of Polymorphism? Differences between
Overloading & Overriding?
Polymorphism is the ability of one object to take many forms.
Polymorphism is one of the oops feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do different things based on the object that it is
acting upon. There are two types of polymorphism -They are compile time polymorphism and run-time polymorphism.
compile time polymorphism - It is also called static binding or early binding. Method overloading falls under
the compile time polymorphism. Method overriding is run-time polymorphism.

Differences-
For overloading methods must have the same name but different parameter list.
For method orverriding must have the same name return type and parameter list.
Overloading occurs at compile time, overriding occurs at run time.
Overloading occurs within the same class. Overriding involves a relationship between a superclass
and a subclass. We cannot achieve overriding wihtout inheritance.
Overloading can be done at both static and non static methods. Overriding can be done only at
non static methods.
For the overridng methods access modifiers can be same or less restricted than the overridden
methods in the super class.
For overloading methods there is no restrictions for the access modifiers.
For overriding method the return type should be the same. For overloading method it can be a same
or different return type.
