What is Inheritance? Benefits? Types? Explain each type

Inheritance in Java:

Inheritance is one of the key "Concepts" in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass or derived class)
to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class).
The subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass, promoting code reuse and organization.

Benefits of Inheritance:
Code Reusability: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes,
reducing redundancy and promoting a modular approach to software development.

Method Overriding: Subclasses can provide a specific implementation of a method defined in the superclass,
allowing customization of behavior.

Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, where a subclass can be treated as an object of its superclass.
This allows flexibility in code design and facilitates the creation of generic code.

Easier Maintenance: Changes made to the superclass are automatically reflected in the subclasses.
This promotes easier maintenance and updates to the codebase.

Types of Inheritance in Java:

There are five different types of Inheritance in JAVA.
Single Inheritance:

In single inheritance, a class can inherit from only one superclass.

Multiple Inheritance (through interfaces):

Java does not support multiple inheritance directly for classes (i.e., a class cannot extend more than one class).
However, it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.


Multilevel Inheritance:

In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from another class, and then another class
is derived from the intermediate class.


Hierarchical Inheritance:

In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.


Hybrid Inheritance:

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance mentioned above.



Java supports single inheritance for classes to avoid ambiguity and complexity associated with multiple inheritance,
but it compensates by allowing multiple inheritance through interfaces.
